## 2025

- **November:** I participated in the Workshop on Network Algorithms, Analysis, and Learning for Science in Berkeley, CA.

- **September:** I joined Prof. [C. Seshadhri](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~sesh/) at University of California, Santa Cruz to collaborate with him and his group on counting subgraphs within the "Algorithms with Predictions" framework.

## 2024

- **December:** I will be joining [ICDM2024](https://icdm2024.org/) conference in Abu Dhabi, UAE. I will present our work accepted as regular paper.

- **October:** I will be providing teaching assistance for the course "Machine Learning" (Fall 2024), from the Master's Degree in Computer Engineering at the University of Padova.

- **September:** I have been invited to [ScalPerf2024](https://scalperf24.bici.events/home) workshop in Bertinoro, Italy. 
I will give a talk entitled "Fast and Accurate Triangle Counting in Graph Streams Using Predictions". 

- **September:** My first paper as a Ph.D. student entitled "Fast and Accurate Triangle Counting in Graph Streams Using Predictions" has been accepted at IEEE ICDM 2024 as a regular paper (acceptance rate 10.9%).

## 2023

- **October:** I will be providing teaching assistance for the course "Machine Learning" (Fall 2023), from the Master's Degree in Computer Engineering at the University of Padova.

- **October:** I received my 3 years Ph.D. fellowship in Computer Engineering at the Department of Information Engineering [(DEI)](https://www.dei.unipd.it/) of the University of Padova. 
I will be working on "Data Mining Algorithms with Machine Learning Predictions", under the supervision of Prof. Fabio Vandin.
