About me
======
I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Engineering at the **Department of Information Engineering (DEI)** of the **University of Padova**, Italy, under the supervision of [Prof. Fabio Vandin](https://www.dei.unipd.it/~vandinfa/PI.html).
I am currently a member of the [VandinLab](https://www.dei.unipd.it/~vandinfa/index.html) and of the [AIDA Lab](https://aidalabdei.github.io/) research groups.

Research Interest
======
My research interests is focused on **Algorithms for Data Mining and Machine Learning** and their applications in large datasets.
In particular, I study the development of probabilistic techniques that leads to efficient algorithm of theoretically provable quality,
significantly reducing the required computational resources. Common applications includes network analytics and clustering on social networks, autonomous-system, and other large datasets.
