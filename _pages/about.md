___
I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Engineering at the **Department of Information Engineering (DEI)** of the **University of Padova**, Italy, under the supervision of [Prof. Fabio Vandin](https://www.dei.unipd.it/~vandinfa/PI.html).
I am currently a member of the [VandinLab](https://www.dei.unipd.it/~vandinfa/index.html) and of the [AIDA Lab](https://aidalabdei.github.io/) research groups.

You can download [my full CV in PDF](https://cristianboldrin.github.io/files/CV_BoldrinCristian.pdf) (Last Update: October 2024).

Research Interests
======

___
My research interests are focused on **Algorithms for Data Mining and Machine Learning**.
In particular, I study the development of probabilistic techniques that leads to efficient algorithm of theoretically provable quality,
significantly reducing the required computational resources. Common applications include network analytics and clustering on social networks, autonomous-systems, and other large datasets.
